## How it works

Users can click on either the "Great Wave off Kanagawa" button and try and find three points hidden on the picture. The clicks don't have to be precise and there is room for error. Once the picture is clicked, the user can choose one of three options. If their option is correct, the red X on the left will turn to a green check. Once all are found, the user will be told the time it took to find all three. If the user has a top 10 score, they can add their name and get redirected to the highscore page. If not, they can choose to go to the homepage or to the highscore page.

On the highscore page, the top 10 scores are listed in ascending order according to time.

## Future uses/ideas(?)

As I didn't have readily available images for more traditional "Where's Waldo" functionality, I settled on just one image. But for other purposes, I've been kind of intrigued by the concept of Dle games like [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle#Adaptations_and_clones) or it's many [clones and derivates.](https://dles.aukspot.com/)

For something like this, I think the concept of a progression of 3 stages, where each stage there are 3 points on a play area where the user will have to click those 3 points as fast as possible. Then the next stage there are 4, and then 5 on the last stage. And then the final screen would show the player their time to complete all 3.

Possibly the inclusion of a daily leaderboard?
